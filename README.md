# Task-Management

It is a webpage project using Bootstrap and JQuery, made with [Zhaochan Shi](https://github.com/shizhaochen1997), [Xinyun Zhang](https://github.com/XinyunZhang) and [Chenan Wen](https://github.com/CaWen).

The webpage is designed to explore topics in Human Computer Interaction. Temporarily no back-end support for it, so that all functions realized with passing values through URL.

Start with index.html, the default username is 'admin' and password is '123456'.
You can switch between week view and month view, and try to add, edit or delete task and see what will happen.
Remember that there is no back-end and database so that your previous modification will not be saved.
